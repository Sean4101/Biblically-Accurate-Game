    like filthy rags!  We all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind, our sins
    sweep us away! - Isaiah 64:6
  - For the wages of sin is death!  But the free gift of God is eternal life in Jesus
    Christ, our lord! - Romans 6:23
  - Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the
    blasphemy against the Spirit, will not be forgiven. - Matthew 12:31
