  - ' Redemption? Is this what they called?'
  - I can't remember anymore...
  - The dept I've laid,
  - The decades spent, riding in the skies...
  - Guiding the angel's herd...
  - From Limbo to Treachery,
  - from Purgatory to the gates to the land flowing with milk and honey
  - A thousands souls for a soul,
  - A thousands sinners for a sinner...
  - I have satisfied the contract already,
  - Yet I've never seen the Star of Bethlehem rise before me.
