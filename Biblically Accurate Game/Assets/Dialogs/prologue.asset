  - Fits of rage! Selfish ambition, dissensions, factions, and envy;  Drunkenness,
    orgies, and the like!  I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like
    this;  Will not inherit the kingdom of God! - Galatians 5:19-23
  - All of us have become like one who is unclean,  And all our righteous acts are
    like filthy rags!  We all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind, our sins
    sweep us away! - Isaiah 64:6
  - For the wages of sin is death!  But the free gift of God is eternal life in Jesus
    Christ, our lord! - Romans 6:23
  - Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the
    blasphemy against the Spirit, will not be forgiven. - Matthew 12:31

  - Redemption? Is this what they called?
  - I can't remeber anymore...
  - The dept I've laid,
  - The decades spent, riding in the skies...
  - Guiding the angel's herd...
  - From Limbo to Treachery,
  - from Purgatory to the gates to the land flowing with milk and honey
  - A thousnads souls for a soul,
  - A thousands sinners for a sinner...
  - I have satified the contract already,
  - Yet I've never seen the Star of Bethlehem rise before me.
  - What could've been wrong?
  - Haven't I cleasen myself enough?
  - Haven't any of  my tribute to the holiness seen?
  - This shouldn't have been happen!
  - The clock have striked 12, the midnight is here...
  - And yet no one comes...
  - Have I been led by the false prophet?
  - The Antichrist?
  - Or am I the one seen as he who spreads the false prophecy?
  - No
  - It couldn't be
  - That's blasphemy
  - NO NO NO NO NO
  - For all what I've done,
  - I have seen more than enough,
  - heard more than enough,
  - spoke more than enough,
  - Maybe there's some mistake...
  - A misunderstanding
  - Yes
  - It must be
  - Yes
  - It must be
  - I do not deserve this.
  - Maybe a talk could solve everything
  - everything.....
  - amen
